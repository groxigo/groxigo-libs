# Release - Publishes packages to GitHub Packages
#
# HOW TO RELEASE:
# ===============
# 1. Create a changeset:     bunx changeset add
# 2. Commit the changeset:   git add . && git commit -m "chore: add changeset"
# 3. Push to main:           git push origin main
#
# WHAT HAPPENS:
# =============
# - If there are pending changesets:
#     → Creates a "Version Packages" PR that bumps versions
#     → Merge that PR to publish
#
# - If versions were just bumped (no pending changesets):
#     → Publishes packages to GitHub Packages
#     → Creates GitHub releases with changelogs
#
# MANUAL TRIGGER:
# ===============
# Go to Actions → Release → Run workflow (for emergency releases)
